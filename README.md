  Install the DLL into your gmod/gmod/lua/bin folder with the following DLL's (EACH BUILD)
  Like So:
  "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\lua\bin\gmsv_egsm_chromium_win64.dll"
  "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\lua\bin\gmsv_egsm_win32.dll"
  "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\lua\bin\gmsv_egsm_chromium_win32.dll"

# Warning:

Please use it respectively. If you got eye strain, please avoid looking directly into it.
Has caused me a level of unnerve, so please use it respectively. Do not enduce people to it,
