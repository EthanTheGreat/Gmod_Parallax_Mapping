# Gmod_Parallax_Mapping
Steps to install:
Requires a DLL from the following operation:
  https://github.com/devonium/EGSM

  This tool is specific to enabling developers to create shaders. Thanks!
  $plm_ bindings are what fold into VMT files. If you review each material's VMT, it will make sense.

  Install the DLL into your gmod/gmod/lua/bin folder with the following DLL's (EACH BUILD)
  Like So:
  "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\lua\bin\gmsv_egsm_chromium_win64.dll"
  "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\lua\bin\gmsv_egsm_win32.dll"
  "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\lua\bin\gmsv_egsm_chromium_win32.dll"
